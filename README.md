# v0-next-js-app-creation

1. started with grok prompt
`create an example of a minimal next.js react app with a button which updates a value with the current client-side date/time, and also showing server-rendered text based on the current date/time on the server.`

2. refined to use RSC
`can you change it to use RSC and also include the necessary App route and other nextjs boilerplate files?`

3. and tailwind4
`please fix the last set of files to use tailwind 4`

4. downloaded the resulting file from grok, and uploaded to a new v0 chat prompt:
`create the files indicated by comments in Next(1).jsx to create a minimal nextjs app with RSC`

5. This just worked. Turned the chat into a new v0 project deployed to vercel and pushed to a new github repo.
